# EmployeeRetention


What is the question you hope to answer?
- I hope to look at the factors that drive employee retention, and how it relates to satisfaction
What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
- I will be using data from IBM that was manufactured, so it may not accurately show what the factors are, but it will show how I can identify which factors relate to retention. 
What do you know about the data you're using so far?
- I know it was created by IBM to predict Attrition. It includes qualities such as satisfaction, which can be arbitrary, and data around years at the company and pay levels.
Why did you choose this topic?
- I am in the HR field, and want to learn more about how I can use data in more of what I do.
